# perceptronRockvMetal
Implement a perceptron to see how well it can classify rock vs metal cylinders given a set of sonar data

This is a project for my Intro to Neural Networks class. 

I implemented a perceptron and used it on a set of sonar data 
to see how accurately I can get my perceptron to distinguish 
between two different classes of objects: rocks vs. metal cylinders. 

Once I implemented my perceptron, I trained it using a subset of inputs from the dataset, 
then validated it using the entire dataset. My program keeps 
track of how many inputs are correctly identified in order to 
calculate the accuracy of my perceptron. 

A test harness was also implemented that reads the data, 
creates the training set, initializes the perceptron, trains it and then tests it.
